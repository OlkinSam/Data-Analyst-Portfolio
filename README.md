# Sam Olkin - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Sam!  I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data specialist. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in data management and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Determining best sales method through analysing sales data (Pens and Printers Company). 
**Code:** [`Sales Method Analysis (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib).ipynb`](https://github.com/OlkinSam/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Sales%20Method%20Analysis%20(Pandas%2C%20Seaborn%2C%20Matplotlib).ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what sales method to use in future work.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of sales. The dataset included sales methods, customer's information, costomers's location and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between sale's period and revenue's desriptive statistics.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that company should combine two best sales methods depending on what time period passed after product had been launched.

### Building interactive dashboards (Adventure Works Company)
**Project Review:** [`Power BI dashboards analysis (Adventure Works).ipynb`](https://github.com/OlkinSam/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Power%20BI%20dashboards%20analysis%20(Adventure%20Works).ipynb)

**Goal:** To create measures and build interactive dashboards.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of sales. The dataset included product information, customers details, locations table lookup and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), creating measures (DAX) and building interactive dashboards.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, dashboards building.

**Technology:** Power BI, DAX, M, Interactive dashboards.

**Results:** Using Power BI DAX measures and different types of data vizualization and data interactions dashboards showing all types of analysis about sales, customer details and products information.

### Stock Market Analysis (Using Monte Carlo Method and web scraping)
**Project Review:** [`Stock Market Analysis (Monte Carlo Method).ipynb`](https://github.com/OlkinSam/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20(Monte%20Carlo%20Method).ipynb)

**Goal:** To analyze risk in stock market.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of stocks. The dataset included closing price, daily volume and other relevant information. The project involved scraping data from web, performing exploratory data analysis, vizualazing data, bootstrapping and implementing Monte Carlo method for risk analysis.

**Skills:** data scraping, data visualization, correlation matrices, defining new functions.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Using Monte Carlo Method and Bootstrapping we defined and vizualized risk for investing in GOOGLE stock.
